# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 20, 2017 Monday (Chrome Extensions via Coding Train)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Tried to make a private youtube site kind of bookmarklet but not done due to getting too much DOM errors.

**Thoughts:** Parsing the DOM and finding the intended DIVs throung getElementsByClassName was a tedious task. Got some of the results like all images turned to my videos thumbnail and links also but not opening my url :< yet! Will fix it tomorrow.
