**Today's Progress**: Tried to make a private youtube site kind of bookmarklet but not done due to getting too much DOM errors.

**Thoughts:** Parsing the DOM and finding the intended DIVs throung getElementsByClassName was a tedious task. Got some of the results like all images turned to my videos thumbnail and links also but not opening my url :< yet! Will fix it tomorrow.
