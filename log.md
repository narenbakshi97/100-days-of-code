# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 20, 2017 Monday 
##### (Chrome Extensions via Coding Train)

**Today's Progress**: Tried to make a private youtube site kind of bookmarklet but not done due to getting too much DOM errors.

**Thoughts:** Parsing the DOM and finding the intended DIVs throung getElementsByClassName was a tedious task. Got some of the results like all images turned to my videos thumbnail and links also but not opening my url :< yet! Will fix it tomorrow.

### Day 1: November 21, 2017 Tuesday 
##### (30Days30Sites Portfolio Day1 )

**Today's Progress**: Made a personal portfolio (not work centric but philosophical kind of.....) using simple html5+css+bootstrap 3.

**Thoughts:** Used the idea from w3 portfolio page. It was a good experiance in terms of writing down my thoughts without formatting them and coding and styling step by step.
